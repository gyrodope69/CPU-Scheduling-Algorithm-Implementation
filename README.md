# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Implementation

This repository consists of implementation of CPU Job Scheduling, both pre-emptive and non pre-emptive.
Also, it will contain implementation of partitioning algorithms in memory management as well as Banker's Algorithm
It consists of:

   * First Come First Serve(FCFS)
   * Shortest Job First(SJF)
   * Round Robbin(RR)
   * Memory Allocation Techniques
      i.   First Fit
      ii.  Best Fit
      iii. Worst Fit
   * Producer and Consumer problem using semaphores
   * Banker's Algorithm
